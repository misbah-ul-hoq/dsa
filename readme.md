# Problem solving patterns

- ### Naive (This is easy but not efficient)
- ### Frequency counter
  Create one or more object/s to keep track of the frequency, And then solve the problem
- ### Multiple pointers
  Create two or more pointers to keep track of changes.. Return the required change at the end
- ### Sliding Window
  Create a variable to store data. Then slide that variable...
- ### Divide and Conquer
  This is found in binary search, merge sort, quick sort etc.....

# Searching Algorithms

- ### Linear Search (Time Complexity -- O(n))
- ### Binary Search (Time Complexity -- O(log n))

# Sorting Algorithms

- ### Bubble Sort (Time complexity -- O(n<sup>2</sup>))
